Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out about the coaching program - great question!

The 12-week program includes weekly 1:1 calls, access to the private community,
and all course materials. You can start anytime and we'll customize the pace
to fit your schedule.

I'd love to hop on a quick call to see if it's a good fit. Here's my calendar
