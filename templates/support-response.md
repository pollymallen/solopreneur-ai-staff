## Examples by Situation

### Simple Question
```
Hi Sarah,

Great question about the session recordings!

All recordings are posted within 24 hours of our live session. You'll find
them in your dashboard under "Past Sessions" - they're labeled by date.

You can also download them for offline viewing using the download button
in the bottom right of each video.

Let me know if you have any trouble finding them!

Best,
[Name]

### Confused Customer
```
Hi Michael,

I totally understand the confusion - you're not the first to ask about this!

Let me break down the access levels step by step:

1. Basic membership: Modules 1-3
2. Premium upgrade: Modules 4-6 + live calls
3. VIP: Everything + 1:1 support

Based on your purchase, you have Premium access, which means you should
see Modules 1-6 and the calendar for live calls.

If Module 4 isn't showing up, try logging out and back in - that usually
refreshes your access. If it's still not there after that, let me know
and I'll look into your account directly.

Here to help,
[Name]

### Frustrated Customer
```
Hi Jennifer,

I'm really sorry you've been dealing with this - that's frustrating,
especially when you're excited to get started.

I just checked your account and I can see the issue. [Explain what
happened and what you're doing to fix it.]

I've [action taken] on my end, and you should now have full access.
Could you try logging in again and let me know if everything's working?

If you run into any other issues, reply to this email and I'll
prioritize getting it sorted.

Thank you for your patience,
[Name]
